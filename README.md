# City of Toronto Homeless Shelter Occupancy Data Graphing

I created this script to go through the city of toronto's [daily shelter and overnight service occupancy open data set](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/).

It'll go through and plot time  series graphs for shelter programs included in the dataset.

Putting on github in case I play with opendata stuff in the future and need a template to help graph stuff.
